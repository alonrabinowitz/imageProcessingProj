# APCS Image Processing Project - Ball Tracking
This repository contains an image and video filter framework by David Dobervich, used in his APCS class.

This program's goal is to find and mark the centers of juggling balls on a webcam feed. It currently works for one ball per color, but has problems with multiple balls that have the same color.
